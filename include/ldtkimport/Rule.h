    *  @details This 2d grid is stored as a one-dimensional array.
    *  It's square-shaped (width is equal to height).
    *  The size of the 2d grid is specified in patternSize.
    *  But you can derive it based on the fact that the
    *  width and height is the same, so:
    *
    *  | pattern length | pattern size  |
    *  |----------------|---------------|
    *  | 1              | 1             |
    *  | 9              | 3 (as in 3x3) |
    *  | 25             | 5 (as in 5x5) |
    *  | 49             | 7 (as in 7x7) |
    *
    *  Values are IntGridValues.
    *  For example, if an IntGridValue of 1 represents the floor,
    *  then having a value of 1 somewhere in the pattern means the cell in that
    *  position needs to have been marked as a floor, for this rule to match.
    *
    *  When the value is negative, it means the opposite.
    *  Again with the floor example, a value of -1 means it requires that the
    *  cell in that position is not marked as a floor (but it's fine if it's marked
    *  as something else).
    *
    *  A value of 1,000,001 (one million one) is special, it means "Anything"
    *  (there must be an intgrid value in this cell, any kind will do).
    *  You can use the const RULE_PATTERN_ANYTHING for this.
    *
    *  Likewise with the negative, -1000001 means "Nothing"
    *  (there must not be any intgrid value in this cell at all,
    *  or you can think of it as "this cell should be an empty space").
    *  You can use the const RULE_PATTERN_NOTHING for this.
    *
    *  A value of 0 means we don't care about the cell at that position.
    *
    *  So for example, a 3x3 pattern might look like this:
    *
    *  0,  1,  0
    *  1, -1,  1
    *  0,  1,  0
    *

    *
    *  Northwest: ignore
    *  North: needs to be 1
    *  Northeast: ignore
    *  West: needs to be 1
    *  Center (where tile would be placed on): can be any value except 1
